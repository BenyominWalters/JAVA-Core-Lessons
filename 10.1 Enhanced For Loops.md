<h1 id="enhanced-for-loops">Enhanced For Loops</h1>
<p>There is another way of writing <strong>for loops</strong>, when you want to iterate through each item in a list. This version is called the <strong>enhanced for loop</strong> and it is usually simpler and easier to read.</p>
<pre><code>// A list (array) of users (Strings)
String[] users = {"Adam", "Sarah", "Jonah", "Clara"};

// This enhanced for loop iterates through the list of users
// and prints out each user.
for (String user: users) {  
    System.out.println(user);  
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="understanding-enhanced-for-loops">Understanding Enhanced For Loops</h3>
<p>The <strong>enhanced for loop</strong> (also called a <strong>for each</strong> loop) tells the Java Machine “For each item in my list of items, do the following.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For each</strong> (item of type String, which I we’ll call) <strong>user</strong>…</li>
<li>that is <strong>in</strong> the array called <strong>users</strong>…</li>
<li>print that user’s name</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll get to use <strong>for loops</strong> and <strong>enhanced for loops</strong> more after we learn about <strong>arrays</strong> and other kinds of lists.</p>
