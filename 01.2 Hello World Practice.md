<h1 id="practice-making-new-classes">Practice: Making New Classes</h1>
<p>Let’s practice making new classes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create 3 new classes inside of your project.</li>
<li>Name the first: GoodMorning, and have it print “Good morning!”</li>
<li>Name the second: GoodAfternoon, and have it print “Good afternoon!”</li>
<li>Name the third: GoodNight, and have it print "Good night!</li>
</ol>
<p>I highly recommend that you don’t copy and paste (yet). It is important to practice typing out these programs to learn the structure of the language. After you are comfortable with the language, you can save time by reusing code.</p>
