<h1 id="practice-using-user-input">Practice: Using User Input</h1>
<p>Now that you know how to get user input, let try making interactive programs.</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-interactive-converters">Missions One: Interactive Converters</h3>
<p>Revisit your Converters for Currency, Unit, and Temperature. Make them accept user input so they will convert any value for you.</p>
<h3 id="mission-two-adding-machine">Mission Two: Adding Machine</h3>
<p>Make a program that will add any two numbers for you and print the result. You can also try a version with subtraction, multiplication, or division.</p>
<p>Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we could make something that can do all of these operations? How do we make a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide?</p>
