<h1 id="continue-and-break">Continue and Break</h1>
<p>Sometimes we need to change the flow of a loop. For this we have two <strong>loop control statements</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Continue</strong> ends the current iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the loop’s statements, and jumping back to the beginning of the loop (the next iteration).<br>
Imagine your telling your Java Bot to run an assembly line making hamburgers. If one falls on the floor, you  want it to stop what its doing to that burger and start again—<strong>continue</strong>—with the next one. (Otherwise, it will squirt ketchup all over the empty conveyor belt, then top the mess with lettuce and tomato.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Break</strong> ends the loop completely. The program jumps below the loop and continues with the statement following the loop.<br>
Back to your Burger Bot. <strong>Break</strong> means stop the assembly line completely. This could be because you’ve finished all of the burgers, or because the factory caught on fire.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-continue-statement">The Continue Statement</h3>
<p>Here is the basic syntax of a continue statement.</p>
<pre><code>for(int x=10; x&lt;=40; x=x+10) {
  if(x == 30) {
    continue; // if x = 30, skip rest of loop and jump to next iteration
  }
  System.out.println(x);
}
/* Outputs (skips 30)
  10
  20
  40
*/
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-break-statement">The Break Statement</h3>
<p>Basic syntax of a break statement.</p>
<pre><code>int x = 1;

while(x &gt; 0) {
 System.out.println(x);
  if(x == 4) {
    break; // stop the loop once x = 4
  }
  x++;
}

/* Outputs (ends loop after 4)
1
2
3
4
*/
</code></pre>

<h3 id="weekday-alarm-clock">Weekday Alarm Clock</h3>
<p>The following example uses continue to make an alarm that only goes off on weekdays.</p>
<pre><code>	// Make an alarm that wakes you up on weekdays, but not on the weekend
    // End the program after 30 days
    
    boolean alarmSet = true;
    int day = 1; // Start counting days from 1 (Sunday)

    while (alarmSet) { // The loop is set to repeat forever. Oh no...

        // If the day is Saturday or Sunday (day % 7 == 0 or 1), using modulus operator
        if (day % 7 &lt;= 1) {
            System.out.println("Sleep well! day #" + day + " is the weekend.");
            day++;
            continue; // continues with the next iteration of the loop, skipping the instructions for weekdays
        }

        System.out.println("Wake up! It's day #" + day);
        day++;
        
        if (day &gt; 30) {
            break; // ...luckily, this break statement ends loop once day is greater than 30. Phew!
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<h3 id="things-to-try">Things To Try</h3>
<ol>
<li>Modify the alarm clock so that the user can enter which days of the week he wants it to go off, and which days he wants to skip.</li>
<li>Let the user choose how many days he wants the alarm to run for, before ending the program.</li>
</ol>
