<h1 id="solutions-calculator">Solutions: Calculator</h1>
<p>Here are possible solutions for the practice challenges. There are many ways of solving any problem in Java, and your answer may vary, or even be better!</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-simple-calculator">Missions One: Simple Calculator</h3>
<p>Write a program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asks the user if they want to add, subtract, multiply, or divide</li>
<li>Print something like “Okay, let’s add.”</li>
<li>Asks them to enter their first number, and prints it to the screen. (Your first number is ___)</li>
<li>Ask them to enter a second number, and print it to the screen. (Your second number is ___)</li>
<li>Print the result. Something like ( 5 + 10 = 15).</li>
</ol>
<p>Hint: You will need to test if the user text equals a keyword, like “add”. To test if two strings are the same, use the “.equals()” method.</p>
<pre><code>String userChoice = "add";
String addition = "add;
if(add.equals(addition)) {
	 // Do stuff..
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is one way to make a simple calculator. Notice that we are repeating a lot of code. Wouldn’t it be great if we didn’t have to keep typing the same thing over and over! Also, if we want to change something, like change our messages, we need to change each copy of the code separately.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a better way! Soon we will learn how to cut down on repetition and make our code simpler by writing our own <strong>methods</strong>!</p>
<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner; // import the Scanner Class

<p>You can improve your calculator by adding other functions—like testing two numbers for greater than, less than, or equal to, or any other function you want to add.</p>
<p>You can also make this much better by having it run until the user quits.</p>
<p>Try putting your entire calculator inside of a while loop that is true unless the user types “quit” or “q”.</p>
<p>boolean calculate = true;<br>
while(calculating) {<br>
// your code here<br>
// if(???) {<br>
calculate = false;<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>Also, include code to deal with invalid user input–anything other than the keywords you expect. So if you expect “add” and the user types “qeqw”, the program should respond with something like “That is not a valid command.”</p>
