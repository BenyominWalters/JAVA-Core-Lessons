<h2 id="do-while-loop">Do-While Loop</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want a loop to run at least once. It will check if it should continue, not if it should run. For example, instructions to boil water would look like: heat water until it boils. The condition is when to stop, not when to start. For these cases we can use a <strong>Do-While Loop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>do-while</strong> loop is similar to a regular <strong>while loop</strong>, but it checks if the condition is true at the <strong>end</strong> of each loop iteration.</p>
<p>A <strong>do-while</strong> loop looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>int x = 1;
do {
  System.out.println(x);
  x++; // same as x = x + 1;
} while(x &lt; 5);

/*
1
2
3
4
*/
</code></pre>

<pre><code>// This print statement is long so it is is broken across a few lines.
// Remember, Java ignores extra white space so feel free to format away!
System.out.print(
	"Every pass through a loop is termed a/an __________?\n
	1. Iteration\n
	2. Pass through\n 
	3. Trial\n
	4. Continuance\n
	5. Loop\n
	6. I give up\n"
);
        System.out.println(" ");
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int ans;
        do {
            System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
            ans = input.nextInt();
            if (ans == 6){
                System.out.println("Don't give up. Try again.");
            }
            else if (ans != 1){
                System.out.println("Incorrect. Try again.");
            }
        }while (ans != 1);
        System.out.println("You got it right!");

<h3 id="things-to-try">Things To Try</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the Scanner inside of the do-while loop. Will the program run? Why?</li>
<li>Place the int ans inside of the loop. Will the program run? Why?</li>
<li>Try changing the choices to letters like a, b, c, etc. Changing the int variable to a String, and then comparing the string at the end of the loop using while (!entry.equals("")). Does that work?</li>
<li>Change the code to allow the user to give up, exiting the code. Change the message to “Better luck next time!” or “Try again after reviewing the material.”</li>
