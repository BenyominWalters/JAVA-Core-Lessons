<h1 id="practice-mouse-over">03.1 Practice: Mouse Over</h1>
<p>Letâ€™s hone our skills!</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-colored-quadrants">Missions One: Colored Quadrants</h3>
<p>Modify your code so that the background changes to a different color for each of the four quadrants (such as red, blue, green, and yellow).</p>
<h3 id="mission-two-smaller-targets">Mission Two: Smaller Targets</h3>
<p>Modify your code to have a square near the middle of the screen. Change the background color only when the mouse is over the square.</p>
<h3 id="mission-three-refactor">Mission Three: Refactor</h3>
<p>Make your mouse detection code into its own method called mouseOver(). Have this method return true or false, so that your draw method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>void draw() {
	if (mouseOver()) {
    	background(255, 0, 0);
    } else {
    	background(0);
    }
}
</code></pre>
