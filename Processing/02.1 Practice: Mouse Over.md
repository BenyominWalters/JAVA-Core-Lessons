<h1 id="practice-mouse-over">02.1 Practice: Mouse Over</h1>
<p>Let’s hone our skills!</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-colored-quadrants">Missions One: Colored Quadrants</h3>
<p>Modify your code so that the background changes to a different color for each of the four quadrants (such as red, blue, green, and yellow).</p>
<h3 id="mission-two-smaller-targets">Mission Two: Smaller Targets</h3>
<p>Modify your code to have a square near the middle of the screen. Change the background color only when the mouse is over the square.</p>
<h3 id="mission-three-refactor">Mission Three: Refactor</h3>
<p>Let’s refactor our code! Make your mouse detection code into its own method called mouseOver(). Have this method take an x, y, width, and height and return true or false, so that your draw method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>void draw() {
	if (mouseOver(x, y, w, h)) {
    	background(255, 0, 0);
    } else {
    	background(0);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>After this method is complete, you will have something that you can use over and over for all of the buttons you create in your projects!</p>
