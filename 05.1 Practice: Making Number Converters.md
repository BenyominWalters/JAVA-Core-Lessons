<h3 id="missions-one-currency-converter">Missions One: Currency Converter:</h3>
<p>We will be doing business with people from many parts of the world. We need a program to convert currency. Write a currency converter program converting Shekels into Dollars, and printing the amount to screen.</p>
<h3 id="mission-two-unit-converter">Mission Two: Unit Converter:</h3>
<p>Did you know that in 1999 NASA lost a $125-million Mars Climate Orbiter because spacecraft engineers failed to convert from English to metric measurements when exchanging vital data before the craft was launched? We donâ€™t want that to happen to us! Write a program to convert miles to kilometers.</p>
<h3 id="mission-three--temperature-converter">Mission Three:  Temperature Converter</h3>
<p>Write a program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius (this one is a little trickier). Be sure to watch the order of operations.</p>
