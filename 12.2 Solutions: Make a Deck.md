<h1 id="solutions-make-a-deck">Solutions: Make a Deck</h1>
<p>Here are possible solutions for the practice challenges. There are many ways of solving any problem in Java, and your answer may vary, or even be better!</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-build-a-deck-with-loops">Missions One: Build A Deck With Loops</h3>
<p>Write a program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contains two arrays, such as rank and suit, or questions and answers.</li>
<li>Use a for loop to add each combination of these to an ArrayList.</li>
<li>Print the ArrayList to display your entire deck.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a solution using the <strong>enhanced for loop</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>	import java.util.ArrayList;

	public class MakeADeck {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {

	        String[] suits = {"Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"};
	        String[] ranks = {"A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"};

	        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; deck = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

	        for(String rank : ranks){
	            for(String suit: suits){
	                deck.add(rank + " of " + suit);
	            }
	        }

	        System.out.println(deck);
	    }
	 }
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the same thing with a regular <strong>for loop</strong>. Note that the index variable needs to be different when nesting loops. It is standard to use “i” for the first, and “j” for the second. You can also use something that represents your variable.</p>
<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; ranks.length; i++) {  
    for(int j = 0; j &lt; suits.length; j++){  
        deck.add(ranks[i] + " of " + suits[j]);  
  }  
}
</code></pre>
