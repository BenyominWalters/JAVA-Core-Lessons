<h1 id="practice-challenges-ii">Practice Challenges II</h1>
<p>Here are some challenges to try at home. If you get stuck, don’t be afraid to ask Google or</p>
<h4 id="challenge-006">Challenge 006</h4>
<p>Write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a circle.<br>
<em>Test Data:</em><br>
Radius = 7.5<br>
<em>Expected Output</em><br>
Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689<br>
Area is = 176.71458676442586</p>
<p>Make it accept user input, and print the correct answer for any radius.</p>
<h4 id="challenge-007">Challenge 007</h4>
<p>Write a Java program that takes three numbers as input to calculate and print the average of the numbers.</p>
<p>Then, use <strong>if else</strong> statements to have it print the appropriate letter grade (100-90 = A, 90-80 = B, etc.)</p>
<h4 id="challenge-008">Challenge 008</h4>
<p>If<br>
x = 2<br>
y = 5<br>
z = 0<br>
What are the values of the following expressions (true or false):<br>
Try to answer these without  your IDE.<br>
a. x == 2<br>
b. x != 5<br>
c. x != 5 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 5<br>
d. z != 0 || x == 2<br>
e. !(y &lt; 10)</p>
<h4 id="challenge-009">Challenge 009</h4>
<p><strong>Extra Challenge</strong> — This challenge will require some research to complete!<br>
Write a program to check whether an entered character is lowercase ( a to z ) or uppercase ( A to Z ).<br>
Hint: You can lookup the ASCII values for these chars. You can also perform greater-than and less-than tests on chars <code>(a &lt; b) // true</code>.<br>
Search online to find out how to get a single char from the Scanner. Something like, “how to get single char with scanner java”.</p>
<h4 id="challange-010">Challange 010</h4>
<p>Make a program that will ask the user for various information and answer according to their responses. Try to include a “nested loop” like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class NestedLoop {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int x = 30;
      int y = 10;

      if( x == 30 ) {
         if( y == 10 ) {
            System.out.print("X = 30 and Y = 10");
         }
            System.out.print("X = 30 but Y doesn't = 10");
      }
      System.out.print("X doesn't = 30 and Y doesn't = 10");
   }
}
</code></pre>
