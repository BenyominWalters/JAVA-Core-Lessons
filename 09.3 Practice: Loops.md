<h1 id="practice-loops">Practice: Loops</h1>
<p>Loops allow us to make a lot of interesting and interactive programs.</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-guessing-game">Missions One: Guessing Game</h3>
<p>Write a simple program that asks a user to try and guess a number. Start with a number between 1 and 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the game inside of a while or do-while loop.</li>
<li>Keep playing the game over and over until the user quits.</li>
<li>Use a while loop, to let the user keep guessing until they get the right answer.</li>
<li>Bonus: Use the Random class to choose a new random number each game.</li>
<li>Try adding a counter variable to track how many guesses the user made before getting the right answer. After each guess use the increment operator to increase the count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how to use the Random class</p>
<pre><code>import java.util.Random;

// The following will print random numbers from 0-9 
Random rand = new Random();  
int i = 10;  
while (i &gt; 0) {  
    System.out.println(rand.nextInt(10));  
  i--;  
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mission-two-sum-all">Mission Two: Sum All</h3>
<p>Write a program that will add all of the numbers between 1 and any number a user chooses. For example, if I choose 5, add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a loop</li>
<li>increment or decrement from the value of one number until the value of the next number</li>
<li>Print the result</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mission-three-enhanced-sum">Mission Three: Enhanced Sum</h3>
<p>Make a program that will sum between any two numbers the user chooses. For example, if the user chooses 3 and 5, add 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.</p>
