<h3 id="explaining-hello-world">Explaining Hello World</h3>
<p>I believe it is important to do something before trying to understand it. This way you have some experience with what your learning about.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve made a few simple Java codes based off of our Hello World program, let’s understand what we just did.</p>
<h3 id="a-word-about-jargon">A Word About Jargon</h3>
<p>Before explaining anything, a word of caution about jargon:</p>
<p>For better or for worse, the world of computer programming (like many fields) has <strong>tons</strong> of jargon and technical terms. Even though it may sound like English, Computer Speak is its own little language, and it can only be learned with lots of exposure over time. These terms make it hard for beginners, because regular people have no idea what these words mean. Yet, the ideas behind each of these terms is usually pretty simple. Don’t be intimidated by all of the new terms, or spend too much effort trying to learn them. Just let let the jargon sink in naturally. After using these new words for a while they will become second nature.</p>
<h4 id="giving-instructions">Giving Instructions</h4>
<p>The essence of every computer language is simply giving a set of instructions to the computer. Each language has its own rules and style for how to give these instructions.</p>
<p>In Java these instructions are organized so that there is one main instruction sheet, which can reference many other instruction sheets.</p>
<p>Let’s use some real-life examples.</p>
<h4 id="example-1-making-dinner">Example 1: Making Dinner</h4>
<p>Let’s say you are writing a cookbook for complete beginners—people that don’t even know how to boil water.</p>
<p>You want to teach them how to make a simple dinner of spaghetti and meatballs. You create a main instruction page called “Spaghetti and Meatballs”. This page contains step-by-step instructions. Yet, in a few places  you reference your reader to instructions contained on a different page. You might write something like: <em>boil water according to the instructions on pg. 12</em>, and <em>cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on pg. 34</em>.</p>
<p>The directions for boiling water and cooking noodles are simple and will be reused often. Therefore, you give them a separate page, and reference that page whenever you need it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse began his career hosting a show called <strong>How to Boil Water</strong>.  This was one of the<br>
first shows on the  Food Network, and began broadcasting in 1993. The<br>
focus of the show was simple cooking, as the show’s title suggests,<br>
and was directed at those who have little cooking skill or experience.</p>
<p>As Emeril’s personal popularity grew, he eventually moved on to his<br>
own show,  Essence of Emeril.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-diy-home-improvement-guide">Example 2: DIY Home Improvement Guide</h4>
<p>Let’s say you are writing a DIY guide to home improvement for complete beginners—people that don’t even know how to hammer in a nail.</p>
<p>You want to teach them how to build a simple bookshelf. To do this, they will need to drill holes, and use screws, nails, and brackets. Your page on making the bookshelf will include step-by-step instructions. Yet, you will send your reader to lookup instructions for the proper use of a drill on pg. 9, and the proper use of a hammer from pg. 5.</p>
<h4 id="giving-your-java-robot-instructions">Giving Your Java Robot Instructions</h4>
<p>Just like these two example, your Java Machine is a complete beginner. It knows how to do almost nothing. Therefore, you need to give it very detailed, step-by-step instructions for every task.</p>
<p>The list of instructions for the task that you are giving Java to do go in your “main” instruction page.</p>
<p>However, any common tasks that you want to be able to reuse and reference in many projects will go in their own page.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s examine our first program and understand what everything means, line by line. Here is the code we used in Hello World:</p>
<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    
      public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<h4 id="lets-examine-line-1">Let’s examine line 1:</h4>
<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
</code></pre>
<p>Every instruction sheet is called a <strong>class</strong> in Java. By “class” we mean a template, or blueprint—a set of instructions that can be repeated over and over to create many objects of that “class”.</p>
<p>For example, a recipe will be used to make many dinners of the same type or “class” (many nights of spaghetti and meatballs). Plans for making a bookshelf will be used to make many identical bookshelves. Similarly, a Java <strong>class</strong> is a set of instructions that can be used over and over. (Well discuss more about classes later.)</p>
<p>Our class is marked as <strong>public</strong>, which means that it may be used by anyone. We’ll learn more about permissions later. For now, think of it like when you buy something electronic. A lot of the parts are locked away inside the case. You need to unscrew the thing to get that these parts, and they are only serviceable to an expert. These are protected, or <strong>private</strong> components. On the other hand, everything meant for a regular user to interact with are on the outside–like buttons, switches, and ports for plugging in earphones, charges, and other compatible devices. These are the <strong>public</strong> components of the device. Our class is safe for a regular user, so we marked it as <strong>public</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>HelloWorld</strong> is the name of our class. You can name a class just about whatever you like. Like we mentioned when creating this class, it is standard practice to capitalize each word in a class name.</p>
<p>Line one ends with a curly brace " <strong>{</strong> ", which tells the computer that a new list starts here. All of the code between a pair of curly braces { …code… } is called a single “block” of code. Think of each block as a separate set of instructions—either a whole page, or a subsection in a larger page.</p>
<h4 id="line-2">Line 2:</h4>
<p>Line two is blank. This is just to make the code more readable for humans. Java doesn’t care about white space. From the machine’s point of view, you can cram everything into one line. Still, it is best to format your code in the conventional way to make it easy for you and others to read.</p>
<h4 id="line-3">Line 3:</h4>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
</code></pre>
<p>Similar to the name of our class, this line names our “<strong>method</strong>” or “function”. A method are instructions telling the machine how to do something. In this case, this is our <strong>main</strong> method, which is where the computer starts. Every Java program needs a <strong>main method</strong>. The computer will follow this master list of instructions from beginning to end, and then close the program. If you need to give the machine any other instructions, they will be references somewhere in the main method. (Follow the instructions for boiling water from page 10.)</p>
<p>The <strong>main method</strong> is marked as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>public</strong> Meaning we give the computer permission to see this method and use it.</li>
<li><strong>static</strong> We will explain more about this keyword later. The basic ideas is that this method will not change, and so it is safe to use as it is written. (Some methods can have many versions that behave differently at the same time, and so need many copies in memory.)</li>
<li><strong>void</strong> Some methods give you something back that will be used in another step. For example, if your giving instructions to make an omelette, <em>step 5</em> might be, “beat 3 eggs”. This returns a bowl of beaten eggs, which will be poured into a pan in step 6. Other steps will not “return” anything, like “turn on the burner.” In Java you need to tell the computer what to expect after each step. Our main method is marked <strong>void</strong> because it returns nothing. Every <strong>main method</strong> <em>must</em> be <strong>void</strong>, because after completing this method the program is finished. Everything must be complete at this point, requiring no further instructions, so that it is okay to finish the program. (You can’t leave your robot holding a bowl of eggs without telling it what to do next.) Other methods might give you back a number (int) or a word (String), like if your getting a username and password.</li>
<li><strong>(String[] args)</strong> Every method has a pair of parenthesis after the method name. A method is telling the computer to do something, and in the parenthesis you tell it what to do that action to. For example, if you want your robot to beat eggs, you would write: <code>beat(eggs){..instructions for how to beat eggs...}</code> You can also give instructions that aren’t done to anything else, then the parenthesis are empty, like <code>walkForward()</code>. When you create a new method, you have to tell Java what kind of things to expect (numbers, words, etc.). In our case, we tell the computer to expect <strong>String[]</strong>. <strong>String</strong> means text, and the square brackets <strong>[]</strong> mean a list. So this means, “a list of words (Strings)”. Then, we give this list a name. This name can be anything, but the standard it to name this list <strong>args</strong>, which is short for <strong>arguments</strong>. Arguments are the technical term for the information we feed a method. You can’t change almost anything else about the HelloWorld program, but you can change the argument name, so <code>public static void main (String[] thingies)</code> is unconventional, but works just fine.</li>
<li><strong>{</strong> Once again, all of the instructions are surrounded by curly braces, to tell Java where instructions start and stop.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="line-4">Line 4:</h4>
<p>Again, blank for readability. Totally a matter of taste.</p>
<h4 id="line-5">Line 5:</h4>
<pre><code>System.out.println("Hello World");
</code></pre>
<p>Here we finally give actual instructions to the Java Machine. We tell it to print the words “Hello World” on the screen. More specifically, "Use you pre-loaded instructions (class) for accessing the computer (System), find the instructions for output (out), and use the “print line” method (println) to display whatever word I place in the parenthesis.</p>
<p>You can use this same command to print whatever you want to the screen. Just put any word in double quotes <strong>" "</strong> in the parenthesis.</p>
<p><strong>;</strong> Line 5 ends with a semicolon ( <strong>;</strong> ). This is <strong>very important</strong>. Every instruction must end with a semicolon to tell the computer when one “statement” ends and another begins. These are basically the same a period for use humans—it marks the end of a sentence. If you forget a semicolon, or put one in the wrong place, the program will usually not run.</p>
<p>####Line 6:<br>
More beautiful white space.</p>
<p>####Line 7:<br>
A single solitary curly brace <strong>}</strong> to end our <strong>main method</strong>. Notice that this curly brace is indented to line up with the beginning of the main method. Indentation like this is used to make code easier to read. Any block of code that lives inside of a bigger block (like our method lives inside of our class) is indented.</p>
<p>####Line 8:<br>
A final curly brace <strong>}</strong> closes our  HelloWorld class, and ends the page of instructions.</p>
