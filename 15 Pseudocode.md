<h1 id="pseudocode">Pseudocode</h1>
<p>Pseudocode is a tool for planning your project. Basically, you write out each stem of your program in English. Then, you can translate each step into Java code.</p>
<p>Translating pseudocode is a good way to practice what you’ve learned so far.</p>
<p>Writing pseudocode is a good way to learn to plan projects and break things down into small steps.</p>
<h3 id="translating-psedocode-to-java">Translating Psedocode To Java</h3>
<p>Let’s try translating first. Convert each line into Java code.</p>
<h4 id="the-basics">The Basics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make a class named Cash Register.</li>
<li>Make a main method.</li>
<li>Print “cha-ching!”</li>
<li>Create a variable for price</li>
<li>Create a variable for subtotal.</li>
<li>Create a variable for sales tax rate.</li>
<li>Create a variable for tax</li>
<li>Create a variable for total.</li>
<li>Create a variable for order number.</li>
<li>Create a variable for product name.</li>
<li>Create a product, with a name and price.</li>
<li>Set subtotal to $15.95</li>
<li>Set the sales tax rate to 9%</li>
<li>Set the total to subtotal plus tax.</li>
<li>Print the subtotal, tax rate, tax, and total</li>
<li>Increment the order number after sale.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="building-blocks">Building Blocks</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make a boolean to compare height and the minimum size to ride</li>
<li>Make a boolean to check that a String is longer than 2 characters</li>
<li>Make an if else statement to check if a user entered “y”, “n”, or an invalid option.</li>
<li>Make a while loop that runs 10 times</li>
<li>Make a while loop that runs until a user enters something</li>
<li>Make a do while loop that runs 5 times</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="logic">Logic</h4>
<p>Try converting the following instructions to Java code.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pass / Fail Tester</p>
<pre><code> if student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
     print "passed"
 else
     print "failed"
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Calculate Class Average From Input</p>
<pre><code> Create and set total to zero
 Create and set grade counter to one
 Create the class average

 While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
     Input the next grade
     Add the grade to the total

 Set the class average to the total divided by ten
 Print the class average.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better Class Averager With Quit</p>
<pre><code> Initialize total to zero
 Initialize counter to zero

 Input the first grade

 while the user has not as yet entered quit
     add this grade into the running total
     add one to the grade counter
     input the next grade (or quit)
 if the counter is not equal to zero
     set the average to the total divided by the counter
     print the average
 else
     print "no grades were entered"
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="writing-pseudocode">Writing Pseudocode</h3>
<p>Write pseudocode for the steps to make change (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). For example, turn $2.53 into coins.</p>
<p>Try to convert this into an actual Change Machine program.</p>
