<h1 id="your-first-java-program">Your First Java Program</h1>
<p>Let’s try out a simple Java program online. It is a long-standing tradition to begin with a “Hello World” program—a simple program that prints “Hello world” on your screen.</p>
<p>To begin navigate to <a href="https://www.beta.browxy.com/">https://www.beta.browxy.com/</a> .</p>
<p>Delete the existing text, and replace it with the following code exactly as it appears. Java is case-sensitive, so capitalization often matters. Also, all of the punctuation like commas, semicolons, and brackets are very important. (Don’t worry what it all means, we’ll explain everything soon.)</p>
<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
    System.out.println("Hello World");
    
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you are done click the <strong>Start</strong> button in the top of your window.</p>
<p>You should see your first error message!</p>
<pre><code>Error: Browxy needs to know the language of your program. 
Please add in the first line a double-slash followed by the language. 
Example //java
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the instructions in the error to correct your code. Click <strong>Start</strong> once to save your file, and then again to run.  If you typed everything correctly, “Hello World” should now display in the black window at the bottom of your screen.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are now a Java programmer.</p>
