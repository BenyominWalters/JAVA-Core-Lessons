<h1 id="solutions-number-converters">Solutions: Number Converters</h1>
<p>Here are possible solutions for the practice challenges. There are many ways of solving any problem in Java, and your answer may vary, or even be better!</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-currency-converter">Missions One: Currency Converter:</h3>
<p>We will be doing business with people from many parts of the world. We need a program to convert currency. Write a currency converter program converting Shekels into Dollars, and printing the amount to screen.</p>
<pre><code>public class CurrencyConverter {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        double dollars;  // declare a variable for dollars
	    double shekels;   // declare a variable for shekels
	    double conversionRate = 3.67; // declare and set a variable for the conversion rate 
  
	    shekels = 150.25; // set the number of shekels 
  
	    dollars = shekels / conversionRate; // dollars equals shekels divided by conversion rate 
  
	    System.out.println(dollars); // print the result 
  }  
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mission-two-unit-converter">Mission Two: Unit Converter:</h3>
<p>Did you know that in 1999 NASA lost a $125-million Mars Climate Orbiter because spacecraft engineers failed to convert from English to metric measurements when exchanging vital data before the craft was launched? We donâ€™t want that to happen to us! Write a program to convert miles to kilometers.</p>
<pre><code>public class UnitConverter {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        // Create variables for miles and kilometers  
	    double miles;  
	    double kilometers;
	      
	    // Set the value of miles and set kilometers to miles divided by the conversion rate  
	    miles = 1000;  
	    kilometers = miles / 0.62137;  
  
	    // print the result  
	    System.out.println(kilometers);  
  }  
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mission-three--temperature-converter">Mission Three:  Temperature Converter</h3>
<p>Write a program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius (this one is a little trickier). Be sure to watch the order of operations.</p>
<pre><code>public class TempConverter {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        // create variables for fahrenheit and celsius  
	    double fahrenheit;  
	    double celsius;  
  
	    // set a value for temperature in fahrenheit, and convert to celsius  
	    fahrenheit = 212;  
	    celsius = ((fahrenheit - 32) * 5) / 9; // parenthesis are added for clarity or order of operations
	      
	    /* 
	    If you aren't careful, you will run into variable type problems.
	    By default numbers are of type int. And an int will drop decimals.
	    Therefore: (fahrenheit - 32) * (5 / 9) will produce 0, instead of 100, because 5/9 = .555. 
	    When this is converted to an in the decimals are dropped, producing 0, and anything times 0 = 0. 
	    This will also work (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9; 
	    You can also make the int into a double like this: (fahrenheit - 32) * ((double) 5 / 9); 
	    Or like this: (fahrenheit - 32) * (5.0 / 9.0);
	    Adding the decimals tells Java to use double instead of int  
	    */  
  
  System.out.println(celsius);  
  }  
}
