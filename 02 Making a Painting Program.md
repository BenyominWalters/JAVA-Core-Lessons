<p>Let’s make a painting program.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to draw a line where our mouse is, but only if the mouse is pressed.</li>
<li>We need a way to clear the window.</li>
<li>We need a way to change colors.</li>
<li>We need a way to change line thickness.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hint-collision-boxes">Hint: Collision Boxes</h4>
<p>For many graphical programs we need collision detection—a way to tell if to objects, or our mouse position, overlaps with an object on the screen, such as a button.</p>
<p>Draw a shape and see if you can detect when the mouse is over that shape. Have the shape react by changing color or size.</p>
<p>You can start with a simplified version, like when the mouse is on the left side of the screen. Work your way from there.</p>
<p>Once you work this out, you open the door to designing many interactive GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), like our paint program or a game.</p>
