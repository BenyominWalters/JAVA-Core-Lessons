<p>Here are some challenges to try at home. If you get stuck, don’t be afraid to ask Google or</p>
<h4 id="challenge-001">Challenge 001</h4>
<p>See how easy Java can (and should) be to read!<br>
Read the following code. Try and guess what each line is doing. Write what each line does in plain English. (The lines are numbered for easy reference.)</p>
<pre><code>1 int age = 27; // declare an integer variable named "age" and give it the value of 27.
2 String name = "Sarah";
3 User myUser = new User(name, age);
4 x = age + 15;
5 if (x &lt; 40) User.askForID();
6
7 while (age &lt; 21) {
8 	 User.applyYouthDiscount();
9 }

10 int[] numList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6};
11 System.out.print("Hello");
12 System.out.print("User: " + name);
13
14 String num = "8";
15 int a = Integer.parseInt(num);
16
17 try {
18 	 readFile("myFile.txt");
19 }
20 catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
21 	 System.out.print("File not found.");
22 }
</code></pre>
<h4 id="challenge-002">Challenge 002</h4>
<p>The following code uses a “while” loop to repeat something. It also uses an “if” make a choice based on some condition. We didn’t learn how to use these yet, but see if you can figure it out.</p>
<p>Fill in the blanks in the following code so that it will print “Yes! Yes! Yes! I’ll do it right away!”</p>
<pre><code>public class YesYes {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
    	int x = 1;
    	while(x &lt; ___ ){
			System.___.______("Yes!");
			x = x + 1; // hint: each time this line is run, x increases by 1.
		}
		if (x == ____) {
			System.out.print("I'll do it right away!");
		}
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Explain the relationship and flow between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source code, written in the Java language,</li>
<li>The Compiler,</li>
<li>Output bytecode, and</li>
<li>The Java Virtual Machine.</li>
</ol>

<p>How does the Java flow described in the previous question help fulfill one of the missions of Java: “Write once, run anywhere”?</p>

<h4 id="challenge-005">Challenge 005</h4>
<p>Try writing and running Java code without your IDE (integrated development environment, like IntelliJ).</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a text file in notepad, or some other text editor.</li>
<li>Write some java code in this file (such as a HelloWorld program). You can copy and paste a working program from IntelliJ if you want to be sure everything will work.</li>
<li>Save the file with the “.java” extension. Remember that the file name must match the class name. For example, “HelloWorld.java” for a class called HelloWorld.</li>
<li>Open you command prompt (in Windows search for cmd from the search bar, or type the <strong>Windows Key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, then type <strong>cmd</strong> and <strong>Enter</strong>). The command window will open.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory with your Java file. (You can save the file on your desktop and navigate there by typing <strong>cd Desktop</strong> then <strong>Enter</strong>. “cd” stands for "change directory, by the way.</li>
<li>Compile your code, with <strong>javac</strong> (Java Compiler). Type <strong>javac</strong> followed by your file name, for example, <strong>javac HelloWorld.java</strong>. Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
<li>This should create a new file called HelloWorld.class (as long as there where no compilations errors, and you have the Java JDK setup properly.)</li>
<li>Now you can run the new “class” file with the <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong>. Type java HelloWorld, your class should run and print Hello World to your screen.</li>
<li>Congratulations, you did things the old-fashioned hard way. You’ve earned bragging rights among your fellow coders!</li>
