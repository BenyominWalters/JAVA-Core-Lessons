<p>Now that you know how to use conditions and get user input, let make a calculator!</p>
<h3 id="missions-one-simple-calculator">Missions One: Simple Calculator</h3>
<p>Write a program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asks the user if they want to add, subtract, multiply, or divide</li>
<li>Print something like “Okay, let’s add.”</li>
<li>Asks them to enter their first number, and prints it to the screen. (Your first number is ___)</li>
<li>Ask them to enter a second number, and print it to the screen. (Your second number is ___)</li>
<li>Print the result. Something like ( 5 + 10 = 15).</li>
</ol>
<p>Hint: You will need to test if the user text equals a keyword, like “add”. To test if two strings are the same, use the “.equals()” method.</p>
<pre><code>String userChoice = "add";
String addition = "add;
if(add.equals(addition)) {
	 // Do stuff..
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mission-two-better-calculator">Mission Two: Better Calculator</h3>
<p>You can improve your calculator by adding other functions—like testing two numbers for greater than, less than, or equal to, or any other function you want to add.</p>
<p>You can also make this much better by having it run until the user quits.</p>
<p>Try putting your entire calculator inside of a while loop that is true unless the user types “quit” or “q”.</p>
<p>boolean calculate = true;<br>
while(calculating) {<br>
// your code here<br>
// if(???) {<br>
calculate = false;<br>
}<br>
}</p>
